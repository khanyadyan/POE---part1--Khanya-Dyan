## Part 2 — CSS Styling & Responsive Design (WED602POE)

This update (Part 2) implements the styling and responsive design requirements:
- Added `website/style.css` (external stylesheet).
- Established base styles and CSS reset, using relative units (rem) and percentage widths.
- Applied typography scales (h1, h2, p) and accessible focus styles.
- Implemented layout using CSS Grid for desktop and single-column flow for smaller screens.
- Added responsive image rules (`max-width:100%`, `height:auto`), and instructions to use `srcset` for production images.
- Added `.card` styles, buttons, and navigation enhancements.
- Created sample screenshots (in `website/screenshots/`) for Desktop, Tablet, Mobile to include in README.
- Created `Changes.md` with a log of edits for Part 2.

### How to test locally
